					<p style="position: absolute;top: 120%;left: 10%;" id="para">There are more than 300 species of the aloe plant, but Aloe barbadensis (aka aloe vera) is the best known and is prized in the health and beauty worlds for its healing properties. 
						<br>
						<br>

					The spiky succulent plant grows naturally in dry, tropical climates in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the southern and western parts of the United States. 
<br>
					Many centuries ago, people realized the plant had more to offer than just being nice to look at. The gel and juice found inside aloe vera became a popular herbal remedy that was used to help treat everything from skin issues to digestive problems. 
<br>
					Let’s take a look at the history of aloe vera and its potential benefits.</p>
					<h3 style="position: absolute;top: 155% ;left:25%;font-size: 30px;color: green">What Is Aloe Vera, and Where Does the Plant Come From?</h3>
					<p style="position: absolute;top: 165%;left: 10%;" id="para">Aloe vera has been known for its healing properties for at least 6,000 years. In the early days, the plant was known for being a “plant of immortality” and was presented to Egyptian pharaohs as a funeral gift. 

Over time, groups from many geographical areas have used aloe vera, including Indians, Chinese, Mexicans, and North Americans, too. 

Humans have long known about the plant's healing benefits, and over the years have used aloe — which is also known as “burn plant,” “lily of the desert,” and “elephant’s gall” — to help treat wounds, hair loss, hemorrhoids, and digestive issues. 

These days, aloe has an entire industry behind it. Its juices are used in cosmetics and personal-care products such as moisturizers, soap, shaving cream, and suntan lotion. The aloe vera product that probably comes to mind most easily is the bright green gel that’s stocked on drugstore shelves. You’ve probably used it to soothe a nasty sunburn.

Aloe vera is also available in supplement form, which is said to offer the same possible benefits to the skin and digestive system as other versions of the plant. </p>
<h3 style="position: absolute;top: 205% ;left:25%;font-size: 30px;color: green">What Are the Various Types of Aloe Vera That People Use?</h3>
<p style="position: absolute;top: 215%;left: 10%;" id="para">There are two medicinally useful parts of the aloe vera plant. First, the leaves are filled with a clear gel. This gel is extracted from the plant and usually used on the skin to treat burns and various skin conditions. The gel can also be found in liquid or capsule form and taken orally. 

The second substance the plant produces is called aloe latex. This is the yellow pulp that’s found just under the outer part of the plant leaf. Aloe latex has been shown to have laxative properties, and it’s usually taken orally to treat constipation. 

The latest in aloe vera trends is the introduction of aloe-based drinks, such as aloe vera juice and aloe vera water. The plant juices are usually mixed with citrusy juice to make aloe vera juice or water to make aloe vera water.

Aloe vera on its own can taste a little bitter, so many brands will add flavor or sweeteners to the bottle. Take a look at the bottle’s ingredients list to make sure it’s not packed with loads of added sugars.</p>
<h3 style="position: absolute;top: 250% ;left:29%;font-size: 30px;color: green">What Are the Potential Health Benefits of Aloe Vera?</h3>
<p style="position: absolute;top: 259%;left: 10%;" id="para">There’s not enough evidence to prove that aloe vera can treat all the health issues it’s said to help with. But the plant has been linked to many potential benefits, including:
<br>
<br>
	Digestive help Aloe latex contains aloin, which is an anthraquinone that gives aloe vera its laxative properties and may help treat constipation. 
	<br>
<br>
	Treating skin conditions, such as psoriasis and acne Aloe creams have a calming effect on the skin and have been shown to help reduce itchiness and inflammation.
	<br>
<br>
	Sunburn relief Some people swear by aloe to calm a sunburn. You might have experienced the gel’s cooling effect yourself, but the research backing up the claim that it can speed skin recovery is lacking. One small study, for instance, found aloe vera didn’t have any effect on treating a sunburn when compared with a placebo. 
	<br>
<br>
	Wound healing Aloe gel may help expedite the healing process of burns or cuts on the skin. 
	<br>
<br>
	Heartburn relief Researchers found aloe vera helped lessen several symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including heartburn, belching, and vomiting. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Lower blood sugar A study found drinking two tablespoons of aloe vera juice every day for two weeks helped lower the blood sugar levels among people with type 2 diabetes. Triglyceride levels of the study participants also improved — a big deal for those with diabetes, because they're at an increased risk of developing heart disease. 
</p>
<h3 style="position: absolute;top: 335% ;left:35%;font-size: 30px;color: green">Side Effects and Health Risks of Aloe Vera</h3>
<p style="position: absolute;top: 345%;left: 10%;" id="para">Aloe gel (the part of the plant that’s commonly found in creams and moisturizers) is generally safe to use and can be helpful in healing the skin when it’s applied topically.
<br>
<br>
Aloe latex, however, can be dangerous. Taking aloe latex orally can lead to cramps and diarrhea, and it could make other oral medications you’re taking less effective. 

<br>
<br>
Aloe latex can lead to more serious problems, too. Taking even just 1 gram orally per day for several days could end up causing kidney damage and may even be fatal.  It also can lower blood glucose levels, so people with type 2 diabetes need to be careful and talk to their doctor before incorporating aloe latex into their care regimen. 
<br>
<br>


Another potential negative for aloe latex: It could have cancer-causing compounds.  A study from the National Toxicology Program found whole-leaf aloe vera extract created cancerous tumors within the large intestines of rats. But don’t be alarmed: The study didn’t involve humans and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says there’s nothing that suggests researchers would find the same results in humans. The good news is the rats in the study drank water containing 60 part per million (ppm) of aloin every day. That’s much higher than the 10 ppm that the industry tends to set as their limit, so it’s not likely that you’d reach unsafe levels.

<h3 style="position: absolute;top: 405% ;left:28%;font-size: 30px;color: green">How to Select and Store Aloe Vera for the Best Quality</h3>
<p style="position: absolute;top: 415%;left: 10%;" id="para">Consult the label on your aloe vera product to learn about the best storage method. Generally, it’s best to store aloe vera gel and aloe vera juice in a cool, not-too-humid environment, such as at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Humidity and temperature can affect the shelf-life of the product. That’s why you’ll likely find aloe vera juice in amber-colored bottles. The dark bottle is designed to keep light from affecting the active ingredients.

Aloe vera is considered a supplement, and supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.  That means there’s no way to know for sure whether the safety or potency claims on the product are valid. And there are loads of products that claim to be rich in aloe vera, but many of them contain no or hardly any active ingredients.  
There is one thing to look for, however, when buying your product: the seal from the International Aloe Science Council, which is an organization that’s been active since the 1980s. Seeing the seal on a product means the product’s aloe vera quality and purity has been tested and confirmed. 
<h3 style="position: absolute;top: 455% ;left:35%;font-size: 30px;color: green">Tips for How to Grow Aloe Vera at Home</h3>
<p style="position: absolute;top: 465%;left: 10%;" id="para">Good news for nongreen thumbs: Aloe vera is a cinch to grow at home. It’s a succulent plant that prefers dry, warm climates, so it doesn’t need to be watered every day. A little neglect in watering isn’t going to hurt it — in fact, it may actually help, because this drought-loving plant lives best in dry conditions. You should be careful not to overwater the plant, and if you keep the plant outdoors, be sure to cover it when it rains.   

Aloe vera plants, which grow to be one to two feet high and up to 1 foot wide, grow best in tropical climates. Unless you live in Hawaii, Southern California, or Southern Florida, you won’t be able to leave it outdoors all year. But you can easily leave it in a pot and bring it inside when the temperature drops (ideally any time it gets close to 50 degrees F or cooler).   Sunlight is key to a healthy aloe vera plant, so position it outside in a sunny spot or inside on a windowsill.  

When planting your aloe vera plant in a pot, choose a shallow, wide bowl so the roots have room to move and spread as they grow.    New seeds will grow around the base of the plant, which you can then take and plant in a new pot.<mark>-"Everyday Health"</mark></p>
